# Project Management Methodology & Setup

## Methodology Setup

We use the Agile Scrum framework as our project management methodology. Scrum provides an iterative and incremental approach to software development, emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and delivering working software in short cycles.

### Why Scrum?

- Familiar to the team, reducing onboarding effort
- Flexibility and adaptivity to changing requirements
- Encourages team to be transparent through daily check-ins and task tracking
- Scrum is an industry standard framework which is widely adopted in software development
- Supports incremental delivery, ensuring continuous feedback from product owner

### Issues Faced

- Sceduling daily scrums can be difficult due to team members being unavailbale
- Informal catch-ups deviate from structured scrum events
- learning curve for aplying all scrum ceremonies rigorously

### Pros

- clear workflow structure with defines roles and events
- Promotes accountability and teamwork
- Project progress is visible to all team members
- Improvement through retrospectives

### Cons

- Requires discipline
- Can be difficult to keep up with if all ceremonies aren't enforced
- Heavy reliance of team communication

## Tool Setup: Notion

We use Notion for scrum board management and documentation. A centralized Notion workspace hosts our product backlog, sprint backlog, tasks and meeting notes.

### Why Notion?

- Familiar platform for all team members
- Customisable Kanban boards for scrum workflow
- Accessable anywhere
- Real time collabration

### Issues Faced

- Limited automation compared to dediacted Scrum tools
- Collaboration was affected due to Notion’s free plan block limits, which caused lag and restrictions when multiple members edited simultaneously.
- Manual setup required

### Pros

- Easy to use
- Flexible
- Encourages transparency
- ACcessible across devices

### Cons

- Lacks advanced scrum analytics
- Manual upkeep required to keep backlog up to date

## Procedure Followed

### Scrum Workflow in Practice

- Sprint Planning – At the start of each sprint, tasks are selected from the backlog and moved into the sprint backlog in Notion
- Regular Scrums – Short catch-ups (sync or async) with group member every other day to review progress and blockers
- Sprint Review – Completed tasks reviewed at the end of each sprint
- Sprint Retrospective – Reflection notes documented in Notion to identify improvements

### Evidence of Use

- Screenshots of meetings and meeting notes uploaded to Notion
- Task History visible on Kanban Board

## Usage Instructions

### Managing Scrum in Notion

- Product backlog and sprint backlog maintained in Kanban view
- Tasks assigned to members with due dates and priority tags
- Progress tracked by moving tasks across “Backlog → To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done” columns

### Daily Workflow

- Team checks the board during daily catch-ups
- Updates tasks (status, comments, blockers) in Notion
- Sprint retrospectives at end of sprint

The chosen project management methodology (Scrum) and tool (Notion) creates a structured yet flexible framework for team collaboration. While challenges exist in scheduling and tool limitations, the approach improves transparency, accountability, and adaptability which aligns with industry practices.
