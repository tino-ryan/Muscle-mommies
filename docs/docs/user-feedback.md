# User Feedback & Methodology

To gather user feedback for our project, we used the following method:

## Method

### 1. Google Form Creation:

- We created a Google Form with questions focused on understanding users' impressions of our product idea
- Questions included general feedback, suggested improvements and feature preferences
- [View sprint 2 survey here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ihPCr1UGzcnIMiT2nzkEq5zqt0ezSRXEbI9rU2Ff0Ksefg/viewform)

)

### 2. Product Pitch Distribution

- Since we do not have a completely usable product yet, we distributed the Google Form along with a brief product pitch
- The goal was to provide context so that respondents could give informed opinions about our concept.

### 3. Purpose:

- To gain insights into what potential users think about our product idea.
- To identify specific features, improvements, or changes that users would like to see implemented.
- To validate and refine our concept before development progresses further.

### 4. Data Collection:
